        About Me

        My name is Mack Jones, and while I was raised in Connecticut, my roots run deep in the western United States.
         My father grew up in Montana and Idaho, and my mother is from Utah. Both of my parents attended Brigham Young
          University in Provo, Utah, and their experiences there have greatly influenced my decision to follow in their 
          footsteps by choosing BYU-Idaho for my own higher education. From an early age, I’ve been drawn to the world of 
          art, largely due to my father’s lifelong interest in creating and appreciating art. Inspired by him, I began 
          developing my own artistic skills at a young age, teaching myself how to sketch and eventually becoming proficient
           with digital tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Blender—an open-source 3D modeling and rendering program. 
           Throughout high school, I pursued my passion further by taking multiple graphic design courses, which helped
            shape my aspirations for a future in design. My love for automotive design, which developed alongside my interest
             in art, has been an essential part of my creative journey. I often sketch and 3D model my own car designs, a hobby 
             I’ve kept up with for several years. This interest in cars has also influenced my graphic design work, with many of
              my projects focusing on automotive themes. Now, as a student at BYU-Idaho, I’m eager to turn these passions into a
               professional career. I believe this path will not only help me refine my design skills but also allow me to build
                on my faith and personal virtues, which will guide me as I pursue success in both my career and life. I look forward 
                to the opportunities that lie ahead at BYU-Idaho and am excited to connect with like-minded individuals who share my
                 passions.

      <h3>Academic and Professional Projects</h3>
      <p>
        As an aspiring designer, I have dedicated myself to working to hone my skills both through education and through professional projects.
        Academically, I have not only taken courses pertinent to my development as a graphic designer, but I have also participated in clubs
        where my skills are needed. In highschool, I created posters for the school automotive club. At BYU-Idaho, I’ve continued to expand my experience by becoming involved in the Formula Hybrid and Electric Racing Club. In this role, I have designed logos, liveries, and promotional posters for the team, which has allowed me to collaborate with other passionate students while refining my design skills. Professionally, I have also gained valuable experience working with Little Big Brands, a branding agency where I contribute to various design projects. My work there includes 3D asset development, 3D rendering, and branding research.

      <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
      <p>
        In my personal time, I devote much of my energy to further developing my design and 3D modeling skills. I find great 
        satisfaction in sketching new ideas, modeling them in 3D, and rendering realistic representations of my concepts. One
         of my favorite activities is designing and printing physical mock-ups of car designs, which allows me to see my ideas
          come to life in a tangible way. Beyond automotive design, I enjoy experimenting with other types of 3D modeling, such
           as designing environments, buildings, and props. These projects have given me a broad range of experience and allowed 
           me to expand my skill set. I take pride in being able to turn a concept into a fully realized 3D model. This process 
           not only challenges me to be creative but also requires technical precision, which has helped me develop a well-rounded 
           set of design skills. I’ve also learned the principles of 3D rendering, which has helped me further enhance my 3D creations. 
           Overall, my personal design projects continue to be an essential part of my growth as a designer, allowing me to explore new
            techniques and push the boundaries of my creativity.
