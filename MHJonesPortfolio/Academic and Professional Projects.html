            Featured here are examples of my work and my journey in studying and learning 3D and graphic design in professional and 
            academic contexts. Specifically included are my projects in highschool, college, and my internship with the New York based 
            branding agency Little Big Brands. Each of these projects demonstrates a certain stage of my development as a designer and the 
            skills I have been able to learn.

            My Journey
        </h1>
        <p>
            My journey as a designer began in highschool through a series basic graphic design courses. One of the assignments included in
            these courses was the creation of a submission for the school's program of studies cover design contest. My submission won 
            the contest. This helped motivate me to continue to develop my skills and combine them with the 3D modelling and rendering skills
            I had been developing in my free time. This led to me landing an internship and subsequent commissions for Little Big Brands, who 
            I developed 3D assets and renders for to display their product designs. After graduating from highschool and coming to BYU-Idaho, I 
            have been able to be a part of the school's formula racing team, and help develop poster designs, livery designs, and 3D assets and
            renders for the club. Pictured to the right is one of these posters.

            Featured to the right are three pieces demonstrating my progress and skill-development as a designer. The first is the created design
            created for my highschool's program of studies. The second is a 3D render of a model of BYU-I Formula Racing's car I created and designed
            a livery for. The third image is a product render I created for Little Big Brands to display their "Sun-In" product design.
