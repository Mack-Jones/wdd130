            3D and graphic design. I have been able to gain experiences in highschool, in my first semester of college, and in professional
            contexts. This portfolio features projects from each of these experiences, with the goal of demonstrating my versatility as a

            </h1>
            <p>
                I'm Mack Jones. Though I've grown up in Connecticut, I have deep roots in the west. 
                My father grew up in Montana and Idaho, and my mother in Utah. Both my parents attended 
                BYU-Provo, which has been a major inspiration to me in choosing to follow the BYU path. 
                My father has also always had an interest in creating art, which sparked my interest in 
                developing artistic talents from a young age. I've taught myself to sketch, use Photoshop,
                 Illustrator, and Blender (an open-source 3D modelling and rendering program). I've also
                  committed to taking multiple graphic design courses at Staples, my former high school,
                   and plan to take more in college. Part of my artistic passion has been perpetuated by
                    my interest in cars and automotive design. I often sketch and 3D model my own car designs, 
                    and have been doing so for several years. My interest in automotive also has impacted my 
                    pursuit of graphic design, as some of my pieces pertain to cars. I have come to BYU-Idaho
                     to start the process of turning these interests into a professional career, while solidifying
                      faith-based virtues that will help ensure my success in life. I am excited to pursue the arts 
                      at BYU-Idaho and cannot wait to discover the opportunities and connections had here.
